        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I currently work some of the time at a horse riding stables, and some of the time as an assessment specialist writing and editing exam questions for Critical Thinking papers. I've previously spent 10 years as a 
            postwoman for Royal Mail, and have also worked in local government as both a Data Analyst and as a Research Assistant. I have a degree in Mathematics and Philosophy, and am particularly interested in logic.</p>
        
        <p>I started to learn coding in Python last year to pass the time while I was stuck at home unable to work due to ill health. I really enjoyed it, and am now looking forward to adding to my tech skills through studying web development with Code First Girls.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working (or studying Web Development!), a few of the things that I like to spend time doing are</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Exploring the beautiful countryside near to my home in North West Essex</li>
            <li>Volunteering with my local <a href="https://RDA.org.uk" target="_blank">RDA</a> (Riding for the Disabled) group.</li>
            <li>Hanging out with my cat Tiger Lily</image></li>
        </ul>
